# Customer Churn Prediction for a Bank

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model utilizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and deep learning techniques to build an accurate prediction model. The final model is deployed using Streamlit to make it accessible through an interactive web application.

This project was inspired by and built as part of the **Complete Data Science Bootcamp** course on Udemy by **Krish Naik**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data manipulation, machine learning, and deployment.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: Libraries used to build and train the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
- **Streamlit**: Used for the deployment of the model in an interactive web application.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Libraries for model evaluation and data preprocessing.

## Project Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Building an ANN using TensorFlow and Keras, and tuning the model for better accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model.
- **Deployment**: The model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input customer data and get churn predictions in real-time.
